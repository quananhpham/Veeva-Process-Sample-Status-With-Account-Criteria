Veeva-Process-Sample-Status-With-Account-Criteria
=================================================

Apex Trigger - If the address sample status formula has criteria on the account object, this trigger will perform a dummy update of the address object to change the systemmodstamp for  syncing. Veeva will not sync new formulas unless record changes.
